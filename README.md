If you'd like to do more advanced changes (e.g. adding a page), the [Material for MkDocs documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/) is very helpful.

### Images

If possible, it is preferable to store image content within this repository at `/docs/assets/images/content`. With external links, there is always a chance that the resource is deleted accidentally by the external hoster.
