## StarLink

StarLink is the current name for the module that allows for multiple instances to be linked together (until we get sued).

Its origin is Super-Sync, which can be found in WLED-MoonModules. Other names used are Mega-Sync, Ultra-Sync etc.

In StarBase (and it's forks) StarLink is a distributed system meaning there is no sync master (there is in WLED) but instances are part of a group. A group is specified by an instance name identified by a hyphen: groupname-instancename.

The Link columns shows group info:

* 0: There is no hyphen in the name, so this instance is not part of any group
* 1: This instance has a group name but there are no other instances in the network with the same groupname
* 2 or more: This instance is part of a group (the number is the number of instances in the group)

Note that an instance in a group can be offline, but as soon as the instance recovers, it will rejoin the group.

StarLink functionality is active if there are 2 or more instances in a group. This means that all dash variables (Variables which will show up in the dashboard ðŸš§) and it's children will be synchronized between all instances of the group. It doesn't matter in which instance of the group it will be changed, all other instances will be updated if it's changed.

In the StarBase demoApp: "On", "Brightness" and "DMX channel" are currently dash variables. In StarLight, "FX" (and it's children/controls), "Projection" (and it's children) are currently dash variables.

On a group of sticks this looks as follows:

(In this video, there are 2 RGBW sticks which behave a bit differently)

## ðŸš§

Above is the current state of StarMod/StarLight.

Below are the works in progress:

* IP, mac-address, name: Mac-address will be the id to store info of other instances in an instance (unchangeable), IP is used to access an instance (can change), instance name is the user friendly name of an instance (and used for grouping)
* Position: Each instance will have a position which is used to order instances
* Synchronized Time: Each instance will have the same time in milliseconds, will have the same random seed and therefore in StarLight, effects will run exactly the same.
* StarLight - Distributed effects: Using ordered instances, multiple instances can each run part of an effect. This can facilitate scalibility, depending on how the effect is implemented. Each approach has different benefits in terms of performance and simplicity:
    * 1. Render only the displayed part. It can be beneficial to use a random seed here.
    * 2. Displayed part plus a bit needs to be rendered
    * 3. Render the entire effect, including parts that are not displayed by each instance. This can be simple, but can experience scalability barriers.
    * Note: Rendering the effect without showing it on leds is much faster, eg game of life about 10 times faster. This is because writing the data out to LEDs requires specific timing.
