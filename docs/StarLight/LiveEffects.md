## Introduction

Live Effects are effects implemented by a script on the ESP32 filesystem ([Files Module](/StarDocs/SysMod/SysModFiles)), instead of precompiled in a StarLight binary flash file. Live effects are a specific application of Live Scripts (see [Live Scripts Module](/StarDocs/UserMod/UserModLiveScripts)).

A Life Effect can be executed by selecting Live Effect in the Effects module. (Currently only one Live Effect can run, more in Release 0.5.0).
