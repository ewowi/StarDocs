## StarLight sound - Design

This is VERY much in progress ðŸš§

* 7 bands, same frequencies as MSGEQ7 (but only if no visual difference in 16 band smooth mode)
* 7 knobs to tune each band
* Master - with option for AGC
* Auto squelch ? (No noise, increase until first signals)
* In effects smooth default on (setting?)
* Save presets (StarBase will implement Presets which can turned on for modules - e.g. effect module or sound module) - alternative to presets in WLED, so no specific code for this in StarLight (except maybe autoplay...)

## StarLight sound - Build

Not build yet (SH007 summer retreat ;-)
