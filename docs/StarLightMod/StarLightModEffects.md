One or more effects can be defined. Currently there are some works in progress

* If adding more then one effect Start and End is not set with defaults, resulting in a crash. Workaround is to set them manually first before selecting the effect
* If there is more then one effect, deleting effects should be from last to first, otherwise unexpected behavior.

## List of effects

This list is not complete ðŸš§

* Rubik's Cube Effect
    * Simulates cube sizes from 2x2 to 8x8 on 3D fixtures.
    * Demonstrates solving by reversing the initial scramble.
    * Option for infinite random turns.

* Game of Life Options
    * Infinite Mode: Continuously spawns random cells, preventing the game from ending or repeating.
    * Color By Age: Cells spawn green and gradually fade to red as they age.
 
* Praxis Effect
    * This effect has a large range of adjustability based on two oscillating functions: the Macro Mutator and the Micro Mutator.
    * Each mutator can be adjusted, with the ability to change the frequency and range of each oscillation. Faster frequency and greater ranges will result in a more frantic effect, whereas smaller frequencies and ranges will result in a more relaxed effect.
    * Try looking at wide range for either mutator, while setting the frequency on the other mutator to 0. Start with a low frequency to identify a range that you prefer, then try adding in the other mutator.

* 1D Effect Rainbow
    * Features speed and scale sliders.

* 1D Effect Flow
    * Features speed and scale sliders.

* Live Script Effect
    * see [Live Script Effects Module](/StarDocs/StarLight/LiveScriptsEffects)
