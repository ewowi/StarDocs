One or more effects can be defined. Currently there are some works in progress

* If adding more then one effect Start and End is not set with defaults, resulting in a crash. Workaround is to set them manually first before selecting the effect
* If there is more then one effect, deleting effects should be from last to first, otherwise unexpected behavior.
