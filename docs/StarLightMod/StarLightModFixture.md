## Fixtures

Fixtures serve as a map to create a software representation of physical Leds. These fixtures can be shared between multiple boards to create a distributed effect in multiple dimensions. There are a range of default fixture types available, but users can create a fixture that reflects the positions and distances between their Leds.
