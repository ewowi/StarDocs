## Fixture Generator

Fixtures can be generated using the Fixture generator module or manually created, see below.

The fixture generator generates predefined fixtures, specific parameters can be added e.g. size of panels etc:

See the dropdown above for all fixtures currently supported

* Fixture: strips, matrix, cubes, rings etc.
* For each fixture:
    * IP: will be used for super-sync (Not implemented yet)
    * pin: the pin this fixture is connected to
    * custom parameters like number of leds, coordinates
 * A fixture can be made out of multiple parts. Parts can be matrices but also rings etc. each part can be specified in a table
 * In the fixtures table, each part can be give a seperate (or same) pin
 * After pressing generate, a fixture file will be generated, see [Files](/StarDocs/SysMod/SysModFiles) and can be selected, see [Fixtures](/StarDocs/LedMod/LedModFixture)

### Matrix and Cube fixtures

* Matrix fixtures have a width and height parameter, cube fixtures a length parameter.

For each panel:

* First Led: the position of the first led
* Row End: the position of the last led in the first row
* Column End: The position of the last column of the panel.
    * Odd nr of columns: if the column end matches the First led then the leds are layed out in serpentine 
    * Even nr of columns: if the column end matches the Row End then the leds are layed out in serpentine
* panels can be defined in a 2D space but also in a 3D space
* Rotation: a panel can be rotated into a 3D space using pan, tilt and roll.

## Manually creating a fixture file

```
{"name":"F_4x16x16","nrOfLeds":1024,"width":32,"height":32,"depth":1,"outputs":
      [{"pin":2,"leds":[[0,0,0],[0,10,0] ...[310,150,0]]},
       {"pin":2,"leds":[[0,160,0],[0,170,0] ...[310,310,0]]}]
}
```

* nrOfLeds, the total number of physical leds
* width, heigth, depth: the physical size of the fixture, in cm ! (note width*height*depth is not necessary equal to nr of leds)
* outputs: multuple lists of pin and a nr of leds, for each led, the coordinate in mm !
* Files need to have a name starting with F_ and extension.json
* Files can be uploaded to the esp32 board in the [Files](/StarDocs/SysMod/SysModFiles) or using the command ```curl -F 'data=@<FileName>' <ip>/upload``` where ```<FileName>``` and ```<ip>``` must be replaced by relevant values
