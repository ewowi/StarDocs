_The MoonModules eco-system, it is a community, it is a movement, itâ€™s a force for positive change_

## Introduction

MoonModules is a collective of light artist, hardware- and software developers. It's been founded in 2021 by Ewowi and Harry Baas who at the time developed audio and 2D functionality and effects for the [Atiline WLED fork](https://github.com/atuline/WLED)

Multiple Segment effects

Since then we have worked on the first release of [Aircoookie WLED 0.14](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/releases/tag/v0.14.0-b1) which introduced Sound Reactive and 2D support as created in the Atuline fork. We also supported subsequent releases until today.

At the same time we developed [WLED MM](https://github.com/MoonModules/WLED), a new fork of Aircoookie WLED as we had more ideas and creativity then Aircoookie WLED could digest. The [MoonModules knowledge repository](https://mm.kno.wled.ge/moonmodules/what-is-moonmodules/) gives an overview of what we made. 
Recent versions of WLED MM focus a lot on large LED installations, Art-Net support, Hub-75 support.

Since 2023, we are also developing a new product suite, based on our experience working with WLED, we took the module concept of WLED and took that further by making everything a module, this was called StarMod. This then allowed us to split LED and non-LED functionality and StarBase and StarLight was born. StarBase containing generic functionality and StarLight to add lighting functionality on top of that. As StarBase is generic and can be used to develop any ESP32 based application, as an example StarDMX is planned for 2025. StarLight key features are 3D support, support for any imagineable fixture, projections, up to 16384 LEDs, Live coding of fixture definitions, effects and projections, artnet and dmx support. See [StarDocs](https://ewowi.github.io/StarDocs/).
(StarMod -> StarLight -> StarBase -> MoonBase, MoonLight, MoonDMX ...)

Our work is open source, so everybody can see what we do and can use it, also commercially. The only thing we ask is you make references to the products you use, and whatever you do with it, that is also open source. For this reason we use GPL-V3 and EUPL-v3 licenses for our products.

At the moment of writing we are Troy, Soren, NetMindz, SoftHack007 and Ewowi you can find us on [Discord WLED 2D & Audio Dev](https://discord.gg/TC8NSUSCdV).
