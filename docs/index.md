# Welcome to StarMod

StarMod is designed for FreeRTOS, the underlying operating system of ESP32. Starmod consists of modules. Everything is a module. StarMod serves as the base of multiple GitHub repositories for different purposes:

* [StarBase](https://github.com/ewowi/StarBase) is the upstream repository containing generic functionality. This works right out of the box. StarBase can be forked to build custom networked applications for microcontrollers.
* [StarLight](https://github.com/MoonModules/StarLight) is a fork from StarBase that includes the parts required to control LEDs. StarBase itself can work without including the LED code.
* Star???? - Everybody can fork StarBase and add new functionality. 

StarMod is made by MoonModules, a group of LED enthusiasts who also made [WLED MM](https://mm.kno.wled.ge) and contribute to [WLED](https://kno.wled.ge) and can be found at [Discord - WLED 2D and audio dev](https://discord.gg/TC8NSUSCdV). Where WLED (MM) is aimed at 1D and 2D effects and fixtures, StarLight is aimed at 2D and 3D effects and fixtures. StarMod has been built from scratch using the experience gained working on WLED (MM).

StarMod will integrate with major IOT/network devices and applications ðŸš§.
